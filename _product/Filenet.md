In the early 1990s, FileNet introduced a more "open" version of its WorkFlo Business System software, the Series 6500, that ran on the IBM RS/6000 platform and the AIX operating system. The networking software utilized TCP/IP but used FileNet's proprietary application protocols. For Olivetti, a special port of the software to System V, Release 4 running on an Intel 80486 multi-CPU Olivetti LSX5000 platform was developed. With the movement to standard PC hardware running Microsoft Windows, FileNet added support for the PC as a client platform with its WorkForce Desktop software. Its old workstation line was phased out for standard hardware and software as demanded by the customers.
