**IBM Business Process Manager** is a field in operations management that focuses on improving corporate performance by managing and optimizing a company's business processes.[1] It can therefore be described as a "process optimization process." It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, more effective and more capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach.[2] These processes can impact the cost and revenue generation of an organization.
